## Historical Significance

The unequal treaties system:

1. **Undermined Chinese Sovereignty**: Created a semi-colonial status
2. **Economic Exploitation**: Drained wealth and prevented industrialization
3. **National Humiliation**: Deep psychological impact on Chinese people
4. **Reform Catalyst**: Motivated modernization and revolutionary movements
5. **Foreign Relations**: Shaped China's approach to international law and sovereignty
6. **Historical Memory**: Remains central to Chinese historical consciousness

The experience of unequal treaties profoundly influences China's modern foreign policy, particularly regarding:
- Territorial integrity
- Non-interference in internal affairs
- Sovereign equality of nations
- Resistance to perceived "neo-colonialism"

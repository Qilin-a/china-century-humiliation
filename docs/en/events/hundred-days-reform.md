# Hundred Days' Reform (1898)

The Hundred Days' Reform (戊戌变法, Wuxu Bianfa), also known as the Wuxu Reform, was a failed reform movement in China that lasted from June 11 to September 21, 1898. Led by the Guangxu Emperor and reformist intellectuals like Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the movement aimed to modernize China's political, educational, and military systems following the devastating defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). The reform was ultimately crushed by conservative forces led by Empress Dowager Cixi, marking a critical turning point in China's path toward revolution.

## Conclusion

The Hundred Days' Reform was a pivotal moment in modern Chinese history. Though it failed spectacularly, lasting only 103 days, its impact was profound and lasting. The reform movement represented the first serious attempt to transform China's political system through constitutional means, introducing Western political concepts and challenging traditional authority.

The failure of the reform demonstrated the impossibility of peaceful, gradual change within the existing system. It showed that the conservative forces, led by Empress Dowager Cixi, were too powerful and the traditional institutions too entrenched to allow fundamental transformation. This realization pushed many Chinese intellectuals toward more radical solutions, ultimately contributing to the revolutionary movement that would overthrow the Qing Dynasty in 1911.

Despite its failure, the Hundred Days' Reform left important legacies. It established Peking University, introduced modern educational concepts, spread Western political ideas, and inspired a generation of reformers and revolutionaries. The reform movement marked the beginning of China's intellectual transformation and laid the groundwork for the political and cultural changes that would reshape China in the 20th century.

The reform's failure also highlighted the challenges facing any attempt to modernize China: the need for broader social support, unified leadership, gradual implementation, and the management of conservative resistance. These lessons would influence subsequent reform efforts and contribute to our understanding of political transformation in traditional societies.

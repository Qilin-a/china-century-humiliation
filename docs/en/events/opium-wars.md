# The Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860)

The Opium Wars were two conflicts between China and Western powers (primarily Britain) that marked the beginning of the Century of Humiliation. These wars fundamentally altered China's relationship with the outside world and exposed the weakness of the Qing Dynasty.

## Background

### The Opium Trade

**Origins**:
- British East India Company cultivated opium in India
- Opium exported to China to balance trade deficit
- Chinese demand for opium grew rapidly from 1780s onward
- Silver flowed out of China to pay for opium

**Scale of the Problem**:
- 1729: Qing government banned opium smoking
- 1800: Imperial edict banned opium importation
- Despite bans, smuggling increased dramatically
- By 1838: Estimated 40,000 chests (2,400 tons) imported annually
- Millions of Chinese addicted to opium
- Severe economic and social consequences

**Chinese Response**:
- Multiple attempts to suppress trade failed
- Corruption among officials facilitated smuggling
- 1838: Emperor Daoguang appointed Lin Zexu as Imperial Commissioner
- Lin's mission: Eliminate opium trade at Canton (Guangzhou)

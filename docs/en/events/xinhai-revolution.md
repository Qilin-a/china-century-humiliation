# Xinhai Revolution (1911-1912)

The Xinhai Revolution, also known as the 1911 Revolution, overthrew the Qing Dynasty and established the Republic of China, ending over 2,000 years of imperial rule. While it marked a significant turning point in Chinese history, it did not immediately end the Century of Humiliation, as political instability and foreign interference continued.

## Conclusion

The Xinhai Revolution was a watershed moment in Chinese history, ending millennia of imperial rule and establishing the first republic in Asia. However, it did not immediately solve China's problems or end the Century of Humiliation.

The revolution's incomplete nature—political but not social, urban but not rural—meant that many fundamental issues remained unresolved. Foreign domination continued, warlordism followed, and true national unity and strength remained elusive.

Nevertheless, the revolution destroyed the old imperial system and created space for new political movements and ideas. It was the first step in a longer revolutionary process that would continue through the May Fourth Movement, the rise of the Kuomintang and Communist Party, and eventually the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949.

The Xinhai Revolution thus marks both an ending and a beginning: the end of imperial China and the beginning of the search for a new Chinese political order that would restore national dignity and strength.

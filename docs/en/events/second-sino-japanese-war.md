## Conclusion

The Second Sino-Japanese War was the final and most devastating conflict of China's Century of Humiliation. Eight years of brutal warfare cost tens of millions of lives and destroyed much of China's economic infrastructure. Yet it also marked a turning point: for the first time in a century, China successfully resisted foreign aggression and emerged victorious as one of the Allied powers.

The war's end in 1945 coincided with the conclusion of the Century of Humiliation. Foreign concessions were abolished, extraterritoriality ended, and China gained recognition as a major world power with a permanent seat on the UN Security Council. The unequal treaties that had defined China's international status since 1842 were finally swept away.

However, victory came at enormous cost and did not bring peace. The war left China devastated and divided, setting the stage for civil war between the Nationalists and Communists. The wartime experience strengthened the CCP and contributed to its eventual victory in 1949, fundamentally shaping modern China.

The war's legacy continues to influence East Asian politics, Sino-Japanese relations, and Chinese national identity. It remains a central element of patriotic education in China and a source of ongoing historical controversies. Understanding this conflict is essential for comprehending modern China's worldview, its suspicion of foreign intervention, and its determination never again to be humiliated.
